# Fibbonoso
This is a simple web application that I'm building. The application's goal is to create a page that performs a linear search on the Fibonacci sequence. I'm including features such as responsiveness and accessibility to make it more user-friendly. That's it for now, but I plan to add more features in the future to enhance the user experience.
